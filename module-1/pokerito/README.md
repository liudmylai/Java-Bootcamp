## Pokerito (it's almost Poker!)
Pokerito is like Poker, but the rules are a lot simpler:
* The dealer will give you one card and the computer one card.
* Then, the dealer will draw five cards (the river).
* The player with the most river matches wins. If the matches are equal, everyone's a winner!
