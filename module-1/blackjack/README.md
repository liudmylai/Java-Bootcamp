Blackjack is the most popular table game at casinos. You're going to build a simple version of Blackjack.

### Features
* In Blackjack, the player plays against the dealer.
* The dealer gives the player two cards faceup.
* The dealer also starts with two cards. But, only one of the dealer's cards is faceup. The other is facedown.
* First, it's the player's turn. The player can decide to hit or stay.
  * **hit:** draw another card.
  * **stay:** do nothing.
* If the player decides to hit, and their hand value exceeds 21, they go bust (lose).
* Once the player decides to stay, the dealer reveals the hidden card.
* Then, the dealer must hit until their cards total up to 17. At 17 points or higher, the dealer must stay.
* You win if your hand value is higher than the dealer's hand.
* You win if the dealer goes bust (exceeds 21)
* You lose if the dealer's hand value is higher than yours.
