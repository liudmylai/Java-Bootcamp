## Airline Reservation System
Create Java application using Object Oriented Concepts. Steps to follow:
- The **airline** has enough seats for 11 people.
- Each **person** needs to apply for a passport, which bears the name, nationality, and date of birth.
- Each person has a seat number, which they are free to choose.
- The airline creates the reservation once it validates the person's passport and requested seat.
- The airline should not create a reservation if the requested seat has already been taken.

### Learning Objectives
- Practice planning code around classes and objects
- Practice applying Encapsulation using getters and setters
- Practice applying Polymorphism using method overloading and method overriding
