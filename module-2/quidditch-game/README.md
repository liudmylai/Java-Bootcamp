## Quidditch Game
Create Quidditch Java application using Object Oriented Concepts that is based on the fictional game of Quidditch popularised in the Harry Potter books.

### Steps to follow
- There are two teams in a Quidditch game.
- Every team is identified by their "house".
- Each team has: 1 "keeper", 1 "seeker", and 3 "chasers".
- During the game, a scoreboard keeps track of every team's points.
- It finds each placeholder and replaces it with a player from a random team.
- If the placeholder is `<chaser>`, then update a team's Quaffle points.
- If the placeholder is `<seeker>`, then update a team's Snitch points.
- Scoring the "Quaffle" is worth 10 points, and catching the "Snitch" is worth 150 points.
- The winner is the team with the most points at the end of the game.
